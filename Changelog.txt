96df549  DayNight: Dialogs and Power Menu Fixes Part 2 * Currently Dialogs and Power Menu do not respect DayNight. This patch should fix all system dialogs and theme power menu. This may not work in every case but users can always revert to day mode when they need to see text that is black on black or white on white. * Thanks to @xWASABI @TheRingMaster & @InkSlinger666 for the different piece/parts of this commit.  I've only modified their work to fit UBERMALLOW. * Also make sure to see the follow-up commit.  I've added a new text style specifically for power menu to avoid white text in light material apps like Kernel Audiutor and Nova Launcher (White on White problems)  [Adarsh-MR]
